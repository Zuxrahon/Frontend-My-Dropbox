## Description
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers.
=> We configure a backend at from a provider and it will handle the load/scaling for us.

## Installation
